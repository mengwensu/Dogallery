        "Blurb": "Contrary to its name, the Great Dane does not actually originate from Denmark, rather, they actually originated in Germany. Great Danes are a very large breed of dog, there are very few larger than them so keep that in mind before deciding to get one. Due to their size it’s not uncommon for them to be chosen as guard dogs. However, this does not mean they have a bad temper, unlike certain other dog breeds.",
        "history": "In the middle of the 16th century, the nobility in many countries of Europe imported strong, long-legged dogs from England, which were descended from crossbreeds between English Mastiffs and Irish Wolfhounds. They were dog hybrids in different sizes and phenotypes with no formal breed.[4] These dogs were called Englische Docke or Englische Tocke, later written and spelled: Dogg, or Englischer Hund in Germany. The name simply meant English dog. Since then the English word dog has come to be associated with a molossoid dog in Germany and France. These dogs were bred in the courts of Germanhunting bear, boar, and deer at princely courts, with the favorites staying at night in the bedchambers of their lords. These Kammerhunde (chamber dogs) were outfitted with ornate collars, and helped protect the sleeping princes from assassins.",
