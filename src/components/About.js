      <p className='aboutInfo'>We are a small group of college students who wish to increase people’s knowledge of man’s best friend, dogs! Through Dogallery we plan to provide a fun and interactive learning experience, sure enough to help all those interested in expanding their knowledge of everyone’s favorite pups, through the simple, yet powerful inclusion of 3D models which is sure to grasp the attention of many far more than any book ever could!<br></br> <br></br>Our goal with Dogallery was to provide an easy and informative tool to help better engage those interested in learning about dogs. Through this, we hope to distribute our product and its attributes to museums and animal shelters across the world, to better engage the general public fascinated in these lovable animals, or better inspire those willing to give these animals a home. So, hopefully through your help, and the traffic you bring to our small website, we can eventually make an impact on the lives of dogs and those interested in them. Welcome, to Dogallery!</p>
