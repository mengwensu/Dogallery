As a result, while not being particularly large they do tend to be fairly strong for their size. Also, while breeders have largely mellowed out their temper since their creation in the 1800’s it is still not recommended to have them around other dogs. As with everything this is not an absolute, each dog is different after all, but do keep this in mind.",
