Their name means “monkey dog” or “ape terriers” in Germany, this could be attributed to the fact that they worked like terriers trying to get rid of rats and mice in Germany, showing their confidence and fearlessness. When entertaining others, their shaggy coat adds a bit of charm to their antics, and sometimes Star Wars fans wonder if these dogs look more like Wookies or Ewoks.",
